# SkillSync
big project for begginers so good thing we teamed, 
first things first is learn how to create and push to a branch so that our work does not collide.

# creating a branch:
  1 in vscode run (ctrl + shift + G)
  2 select or type (New branch) 
  3 enter branch name 
  4 press enter to create branch
  5 switch to the branch by running (git checkout "name of branch"),
    most likely you'll already be in it 
#  pushing to branch
  1 it's the usual git add .
  2 git commit -m"message"
  3 git push origin (branch_name)

i would advice you all to create a virtual env for on your pc before installing any modules,
i will create a requirement file to save you time on wich module we'll likely need

# happy coding
